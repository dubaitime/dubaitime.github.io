In a growing dispute, Twitter has issued a threat to sue Meta over its newly launched Threads app, which Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, openly positioned as a rival to Twitter. Twitter claims that Meta has infringed upon its "intellectual property rights," as stated in a letter addressed to Zuckerberg and first published by Semafor, a news outlet. The letter, written by Twitter's lawyer, Alex Spiro, accuses Meta of willful and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter's trade secrets and other confidential information.

## Threads, a companion app for Instagram

In response to the launch of Threads, Meta's text-based conversation app aiming to compete with Twitter, the reception has been largely positive. According to Meta, Threads achieved an impressive 30 million sign-ups within 24 hours of its release, potentially making it the fastest-downloaded app ever. By linking Threads accounts to Instagram profiles, Meta streamlined the sign-up process, leveraging the built-in user base of the popular photo-sharing platform.

Zuckerberg referred to Threads as Meta's attempt to create a "public conversations app with 1bn+ people," highlighting the opportunity that he believes Twitter missed. He expressed satisfaction with Threads' initial success, stating, "This is as good of a start as we could have hoped for!"

Twitter's cease-and-desist letter alleges that Meta has recruited numerous former Twitter employees over the past year, some of whom had access to Twitter's trade secrets and confidential information. The letter claims that these individuals were deliberately assigned to develop Meta's Threads app, using Twitter's intellectual property to expedite its developmentâ€”an act that Twitter argues violates state and federal laws, as well as the former employees' ongoing obligations to Twitter.

Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter, tweeted in response to the situation, stating, "Competition is fine, cheating is not."

Meta's communications director, Andy Stone, countered Twitter's claims in a Threads post, stating that there are no engineers on the Threads team who previously worked at Twitter. It remains uncertain what evidence Twitter possesses regarding former employees' ongoing access to its intellectual property or trade secrets. When approached for comment, Twitter responded with an automated email containing a poop emoji.

Additionally, Twitter has accused Meta of being "prohibited" from data scraping any Twitter services. Elon Musk has recently implemented measures to restrict data scraping from Twitter, such as limiting the number of tweets users can view per day. Musk stated that this was in response to companies using Twitter to train their AI models.

## Similar Cases in Tech Industry

The potential lawsuit over trade secret appropriation carries significance within the tech industry. A notable example occurred in 2018 when [Waymo](https://waymo.com/), the self-driving [car company](https://www.knot35.com/craigslist/) owned by Google, sued Uber for trade secret theft. This ensued after a high-ranking executive at Waymo left the company to join Uber's self-driving technology division. Google and Uber eventually settled the case for $245 million. The implicated employee, Anthony Levandowski, later faced charges of trade secret theft and received an 18-month prison sentence, which was subsequently pardoned by former President Donald Trump.

As the dispute between Twitter and Meta unfolds, the repercussions of intellectual property violations and the prospect of legal action loom over their rivalry.
