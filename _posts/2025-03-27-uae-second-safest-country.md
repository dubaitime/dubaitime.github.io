The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has solidified its reputation as one of the world's safest nations, ranking second in the 2025 Numbeo Safety Index. With an impressive safety score of 84.5, the UAE continues to demonstrate its commitment to security, peace, and quality of life for residents and visitors alike.

According to the comprehensive survey by Numbeo, a crowd-sourced online database, the UAE narrowly missed the top spot to Andorra, a small European principality. Andorra edged out the UAE with a safety index score of 84.7 â€“ a difference of just two-tenths of a point.  

## Gulf Countries Dominate Safety Rankings  
The UAE's achievement is part of a broader success for Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries:  
- Qatar secured third place with a safety index of 84.2  
- Oman rounded out the top five with a score of 81.7  
This remarkable performance highlights the region's focus on security, law enforcement, and social stability.  

## What Makes the UAE So Safe?  
Several factors contribute to the UAE's high safety ranking:  
1. **Strict Legal Framework**: The country is known for its stringent laws regarding crime, drug use, and public behavior, with severe penalties for violations.  
2. **Advanced Security Infrastructure**: Cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi boast extensive surveillance systems and a strong police presence.  
3. **Multicultural Society**: Home to over 200 nationalities, the UAE has created a harmonious environment that prioritizes mutual respect and safety.

- The United Kingdom ranked **87th**  
- The United States placed **89th**  
- India ranked **66th**  
- Venezuela was identified as the **least safe country**
