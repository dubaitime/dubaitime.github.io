## Why Extend Your UAE Entry Permit?
Let's be honest - the UAE has a way of making you want to stick around longer than planned. Maybe you've discovered a hidden gem of a restaurant, made some great friends, or just need more time for that business deal to close.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Extending Your UAE Entry Permit
1.	**Check Your Eligibility:** Good news! Most tourist and visit visas can be extended twice, giving you an extra 30 days each time. Unfortunately, those short transit visas usually can't be extended - but hey, it's worth checking your specific case.
2.	**Apply Before the Expiration Date:** Here's a pro tip: don't wait until the last minute! The UAE isn't too fond of overstayers, and they show it with their fines - AED 200 for day one, and it only goes up from there. Mark your calendar and plan ahead!

    *  If you're in Dubai: Head to the GDRFA website (they handle Dubai-issued permits)

    *  Your passport (make sure it's valid for at least six months)
    *  Current permit details
    *  A recent passport photo (UAE style!)
5.	**Submit the Application and Pay the Fee:** Time to bite the bullet and pay that fee - usually around AED 600 for 30 days. Yes, it's not cheap, but it's way better than overstay fines! Submit everything online or let your travel agency handle it.
6.	**Await Approval:** Now comes the waiting game - but don't worry, it's usually pretty quick. A few hours to a couple of days tops. Keep checking the website for updates, and once approved, you're good to go!
