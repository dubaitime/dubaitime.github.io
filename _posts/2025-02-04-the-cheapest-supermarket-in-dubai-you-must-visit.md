Dubai residents consider **Viva Supermarket** to be the least expensive grocery store within the city. The discount supermarket provides cheaper prices for its store brands rather than international brand products. The store limits its product range which means you will need to shop elsewhere for specific items.

**Pros:**
- Extremely affordable prices
- Discounted bulk items
- Convenient locations

**Cons:**
- Limited product variety
- The quality standards for different products differ at this particular store

**Tip:** Shop first at Viva before buying other items at the bigger supermarkets such as Carrefour and Lulu Hypermarket.

## 2. Nesto Hypermarket – Value for Money
**Nesto Hypermarket** provides customers with affordable pricing on their diverse selection of grocery items from fresh vegetables to dairy products and home necessities. This establishment provides customers with reasonable prices while offering a wide selection of products.

**Pros:**
- Competitive prices

**Cons:**
- Price levels at this store can change according to branch locations
- Certain imported products might be expensive at Nesto Hypermarket

**Tip:** You can save the most money by monitoring weekend deals and package discounts available at Nesto.

## 3. Lulu Hypermarket – Affordable and Convenient
Dubai residents seek **Lulu Hypermarket** as one of their most chosen supermarket chains because it delivers a wide range of merchandise at affordable rates. Lulu delivers superior shopping with various brands alongside better quality items even though its prices exceed those of Viva.

**Pros:**
- Great balance of price and quality
- Mobile app for home deliveries
- Frequent promotions and discounts

**Cons:**
- The prices at Lulu Hypermarket exceed those of both Viva and Nesto

## 5. Baqer Mohebi – Wholesale Prices on Groceries
