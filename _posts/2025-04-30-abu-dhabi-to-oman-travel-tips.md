The border crossings between the UAE and Oman have distinct entry requirements which vary from crossing to crossing:
1. Khatm Al Shiklah Border (Near Al Ain) - Popular for Abu Dhabi travelers  
2. Hatta Border - Scenic route with beautiful mountain views  
3. Mezyad Border - Close to Al Ain, about 20 minutes from Hafeet  
4. Al Wajajah Border - Southern crossing point  
5. Dibba Border - Coastal route option  

**Note:** The Kalba border entrance accepts only GCC nationals as visitors.

## Essential Documentation Checklist
Check all necessary items before starting your trip:
- Passport with at least 6 months validity (renewed passports must be updated with your visa)  
- Emirates ID  
- Vehicle registration card (mulkiya)  
- Car insurance covering Oman (details below)  
- 30 AED exit fee per person (card payment accepted)  
- Bank NOC if your car is under finance (not always required but recommended)  

## Oman Car Insurance (Orange Card)
The requirement of vehicle insurance becomes compulsory for all drivers entering Oman:
- Your present UAE policy might extend its coverage to Oman (double-check)  
- If not covered, purchase insurance at the border (around 100 AED for 10 days)  
- Border area insurance machines will charge higher premiums than what the traveler support office provides  
- Insurance providers will add Oman coverage for 70 AED when customers arrange it in advance.  

**Pro Tip:** Financed car owners must check with their bank to determine if a bank NOC is needed since border crossing requirements differ.
