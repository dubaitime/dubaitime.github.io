New traffic offenders in Dubai are often caught running a red light, which results in heavy fines, black points on your license, and even the confiscation of your car. The consequences depend on several factors, such as whether there were cameras monitoring the intersection. In this article, you will learn how to know if you have gone through a red light, the penalties you might face, and what to do when penalized.

## 1. No Camera, No Fine

Sometimes, you may overtake cars at a red light but not be fined because there is no camera to record your violation. However, this is not always the case. Even without a camera, a police officer might have witnessed your violation and issued a fine.

## 2. Camera-Captured Offense

If you were at a junction with a red light camera, the chances of receiving a fine are high if you ran the red light. The fine will be paid by the rental car company, which will then bill you for the amount. The fines could take almost a week or even longer to update and be sent to offenders, so it's wise to stay alert for several weeks after visiting Dubai.

## 3. Points and Suspension

Running a red light in Dubai results in the accumulation of 12 ‘black points’ on your record. If you collect 24 black points within two years, your license will be confiscated for one month. Accumulating more points will result in a longer suspension period. Additionally, you may lose your car for 30 days, face a fine of up to AED 1,000, and be subjected to civil penalties. If the intersection is frequented by pedestrians or trams, the fine may be slightly higher.

## 4. No Fine, but a Report

In some cases, a person may report your offense through an app or as a witness. If this happens, you will receive a fine in your mail within a week of the event being reported to the authorities. While it's rare for someone to report you via an app, it is still a possibility.

## Conclusion

In Dubai, it's not always easy to tell if you have violated a red light, as the penalty depends on whether the intersection was monitored by a camera or observed by a police officer. If you're unsure whether you have committed a traffic violation, you can wait for fines and notifications to arrive via email or post. If you do receive a fine, ensure you pay it promptly to avoid further actions from the authorities, such as black points on your license or the confiscation of your car. With numerous traffic regulations in place, it's important to stay cautious while driving in Dubai to avoid repeating these offenses.
